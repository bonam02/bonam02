first install python

Step1) python3 -m venv venv
       This will create a new folder, venv, in your home folder, which will contain your virtual environment.

Step2) Activate the virtual environment by typing : source ~/venv/bin/activate
       ~ is shorthand for your home folder. So this actually translates to: source /Users/[your-username]/bin/activate
       If the command is successful, a (venv) should appear in front of your terminal prompt.

 Now it will activate virtual environment
